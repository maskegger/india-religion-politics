# Data on religion and politics in India 

## upgis

This table contains GIS coordinates and other spatial characteristics of polling booths in Uttar Pradesh.

Note that this table itself does not integrate data across various years, but such integration can be achieved via the [upid](https://github.com/raphael-susewind/india-religion-politics/tree/master/upid) table. This is just a long dump for GIS data so that the upid table does not get too cluttered.

## Variables

name | description
--- | ---
ac_id_09 | ID code of the assembly segment assigned by the Election Commission (identical with all other post-delimitation codes, hence the _09)
booth_id_09 | ID code of the polling booth assigned by the Election Commission for 2009 booths (together with ac_id_09, this should suffice for matching with other tables)
booth_name_09 | Name of the polling booth assigned by the Election Commission for 2009 booths
district_name_09 | Name of the district into which this polling booth is supposed to fall in 2009 (could be used for cleaning the data)
booth_id_12 | ID code of the polling booth assigned by the Election Commission for 2011-2013 booths (together with ac_id_09, this should suffice for matching with other tables)
booth_name_12 | Name of the polling booth assigned by the Election Commission for 2011-2013 booths
district_name_12 | Name of the district into which this polling booth is supposed to fall in 2011-2013 (could be used for cleaning the data)
booth_id_14 | ID code of the polling booth assigned by the Election Commission for 2014 booths (together with ac_id_09, this should suffice for matching with other tables)
booth_name_14 | Name of the polling booth assigned by the Election Commission for 2014 booths
district_name_14 | Name of the district into which this polling booth is supposed to fall in 2014 (could be used for cleaning the data)
booth_id_17 | ID code of the polling booth assigned by the Election Commission for 2017 booths (together with ac_id_09, this should suffice for matching with other tables)
district_name_17 | Name of the district into which this polling booth is supposed to fall in 2017 (could be used for cleaning the data)
booth_id_21 | ID code of the polling booth assigned by the Election Commission for 2021 booths (together with ac_id_09, this should suffice for matching with other tables)
latitude | Geographical latitude
longitude | Geographical longitude
modis | Urban area or not? Derived from MODIS polygon (see below)
modis_rank | How urban? MODIS Scalerank (see below)

## Raw data

The 2009 data was originally scraped using 2009/download.pl in spring 2012 from http://gis.up.nic.in:8080/srishti/psmapping. This was an early case study of the UP NIC, and hence only covers Firozabad, Bareilly, Lucknow, Faizabad, Gonda and Chandauli districts. Lucknow data was manually corrected and cleaned; I cannot vouch for the other districts. The ID codes are the same used for the 2009 Lok Sabha elections.

The 2012 data was originally scraped using the Firefox MozRepl plugin in conjunction with 2012/download.pl and the custom proxy server at 2012/proxy.pl on May 27, 2013 from http://www.eci-polldaymonitoring.nic.in/psleci. The data used here is NOT cleaned up, and quality varies from district to district, so you need to be careful. The ID codes are the same used for the 2012 Vidhan Sabha elections.

The 2014 data was originally scraped using the Firefox MozRepl plugin in conjunction with 2014/download.pl and the custom proxy server at 2014/proxy.pl on May 5, 2014 from "http://www.eci-polldaymonitoring.nic.in/psleci; the same caveats regarding data quality apply, but now the ID codes are the same used for the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. This dataset is identical with the data included in my (more comprehensive) [GIS Shapefiles](http://dx.doi.org/10.4119/unibi/2674065).

The 2017 data was originally scraped using 2017/download.pl on January 11, 2017 from "http://gis.up.nic.in/srishti/election2017", including a "List of unavailable polling stations" linked on that page. The ID codes are the same used for the 2017 Vidhan Sabha elections.

All four sets of point data were then dumped into CSVs, transformed into ESRI shapefiles using `ogr2ogr booths-locality.shp booths-locality.vrt` and matched manually against the MODIS polygon from [Naturalearth](http://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/10m-cultural-vectors/10m-urban-area/) using QGIS. The result was then exported back into booths-locality-modis.sqlite.

The final table was put together using `cat transform.sql | sqlite3`.

The 2021 data was scraped from an API used within https://electoralsearch.in using download2021.pl and is included into the main database using upgis2021.sql; note that the 2021 booth IDs are NOT identical with any of the previous booth IDs.

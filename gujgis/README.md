# Data on religion and politics in India 

## gujgis

This table contains GIS coordinates and other spatial characteristics of polling booths in Gujarat

## Variables

name | description
--- | ---
ac_id_09 | ID code of the assembly segment assigned by the Election Commission (identical with all other post-delimitation codes, hence the _09)
booth_id_14 | ID code of the polling booth assigned by the Election Commission for 2014 booths (together with ac_id_09, this should suffice for matching with other tables)
booth_name_14 | Name of the polling booth assigned by the Election Commission for 2014 booths
district_name_14 | Name of the district into which this polling booth is supposed to fall in 2014 (could be used for cleaning the data)
booth_id_21 | ID code of the polling booth assigned by the Election Commission for 2021 booths (together with ac_id_09, this should suffice for matching with other tables)
latitude | Geographical latitude
longitude | Geographical longitude
modis | Urban area or not? Derived from MODIS polygon (see below)
modis_rank | How urban? MODIS Scalerank (see below)

## Raw data

The 2014 data was originally scraped using the Firefox MozRepl plugin in conjunction with download.pl and the custom proxy server at proxy.pl on May 5, 2014 from "http://www.eci-polldaymonitoring.nic.in/psleci. The data used here is NOT cleaned up, and quality varies from district to district, so you need to be careful. The ID codes are the same used for the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. This dataset is identical with the data included in my (more comprehensive) [GIS Shapefiles](http://dx.doi.org/10.4119/unibi/2674065).

All three sets of point data were then dumped into CSVs, transformed into ESRI shapefiles using `ogr2ogr booths-locality.shp booths-locality.vrt` and matched manually against the MODIS polygon from [Naturalearth](http://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/10m-cultural-vectors/10m-urban-area/) using QGIS. The result was then exported back into booths-locality-modis.sqlite.

The final table was put together using `cat transform.sql | sqlite3`.

The 2021 data was scraped from an API used within https://electoralsearch.in using download2021.pl and is included into the main database using gujgis2021.sql; note that the 2021 booth IDs are NOT identical with 2014 booth IDs.
